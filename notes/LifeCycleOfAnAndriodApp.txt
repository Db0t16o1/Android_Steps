An Andriod app undergoes various cycles in its life time(the time between its launch and exit). These cycles are -:
1. onCreate
2. onStart
3. onResume
4. onPause
5. onStop
6. onDestroy

onCreate :- 
We know that UI elements are actually Java objects in heap. The onCreate method place these UI elements in memory.

onStart :-
This is the stage when elements appear to the user but he/she can still not interact with them, in other words it is the stage when the UI elements are visible to the user.

OnResume -
The stage when the user can make interaction with the UI elements.

onPause :-
User can no longer make interaction with the UI elements.

onStop :-
UI elements are removed from the screen(no longer visible to the user, but they are present in the memory). This happens when the user toogles from one app to the other.

onDestory :-
UI objects are removed from the memory, this happens when the user quits the app/
