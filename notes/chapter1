1. LinearLayout inherits from a subclass of View named ViewGroup . A ViewGroup is a widget that
contains and arranges other widgets. You use a LinearLayout when you want widgets arranged
in a single column or row. Other ViewGroup subclasses are FrameLayout , TableLayout , and
RelativeLayout .
2.match_parent view will be as big as its parent
wrap_content view will be as big as its contents require
3.dp is density independent pxels.
4.The order in which children are defined determines the order in which they appear on screen.In a horizontal LinearLayout , the
first child defined will be leftmost. (Unless the language of the device is a language that runs right-to-
left, such as Arabic or Hebrew. In that case, the first child will be rightmost.)
5.android:text attributes are not literal strings. They are references to string resources.
A string resource is a string that lives in a separate XML file called a strings file. You can give a widget
a hard-coded string, like android:text="True" , but it is usually not a good idea. Placing strings into a
separate file and then referencing them is better because it makes localization easy.
6.Although the default strings file is named strings.xml , you can name a strings file anything you want.
You can also have multiple strings files in a project. As long as the file is located in res/values/ , has
a resources root element, and contains child string elements, your strings will be found and used
appropriately.
